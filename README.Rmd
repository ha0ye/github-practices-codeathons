## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("articulate the differences between `git` and `Github`", 
                       "understand essential features of working in git and github
  - commits as project snapshots
  - branches as ways to experiment
  - remotes and clones
  - collaboration workflow", 
  "create and navigate branches", 
  "create and merge pull requests", 
  "use the \"Github Flow\" system")
