<h2 id="intro">Intro<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intro"></a></h2>
<p>🚀 You’ve got a team and a project idea and are ready to GO! 🚀 How do you effectively work together?? * Can you edit someone else’s changes? * Can multiple people update the codebase at the same time? * How do you save everyone’s work, just in case? * How do external folks contribute to the project? * What is in this talk? 1 hour is only enough time to go over basic concepts and workflow practices. - enough to get started (even if you haven’t used git or github before) We will conclude with a quick hands-on exercise using the GitHub website. (If teams do not yet have a shared repo that every team member has access to, <strong>please speak up now</strong>!) This lesson teaches you to: NA * Basic Concepts * Version Control <strong>Version Control</strong>: tools/systems to manage changes to files ## You are probably already using version control! * MS Word has “track changes” * Dropbox / Google Drive can revert versions * Why Learn Git &amp; GitHub Git &amp; GitHub are version control for <strong>projects</strong>. You can: * restore project states involving changes to multiple files. * track <em>who</em> made <em>what</em> changes and <em>why</em> * handle changes in any file format * manage work from large distributed teams * Git and GitHub ## (not the same thing!) * Git * <strong>Git</strong> is the name of the software and the associated version control system * default interface is the command line - commands have unintuitive names - error messages can be obscure * many other tools improve on the experience - graphical interface - integration with other things, including GitHub * GitHub * a cloud platform that hosts Git repos * unlimited <em>public</em> and <em>private</em> repos * size limits: - 1 GB for each repo - 100 MB for individual files * GitHub Actions provide continuous integration - great for testing or deploying * Git tracks versions for <strong>projects</strong> * Basic Mechanics * Versioning occurs on the level of a projects: - A project folder is a <strong>repository</strong> or <strong>repo</strong>, for short. * Changes are recorded by taking a snapshot of the folder: - each snapshot is called a <strong>commit</strong>. <img src="commits_example.png" title="A screenshot of the website https://github.com/uf-repro/friendly-github-intro/commits/main, showing the commit log for the repo of the Friendly Github Intro lesson. Each commit entry has an associated date and time, the author, and the summary of the commit message." alt="A screenshot of the website https://github.com/uf-repro/friendly-github-intro/commits/main, showing the commit log for the repo of the Friendly Github Intro lesson. Each commit entry has an associated date and time, the author, and the summary of the commit message." width="1505"> * Commit Structure * each commit has a <strong>commit message</strong> - 1-line summary (required) - blank line - further details * each commit also records <strong>who</strong> and <strong>when</strong> * good commit messages help you find the right past project state! <img src="commits_example.png" title="A screenshot of the website https://github.com/uf-repro/friendly-github-intro/commits/main, showing the commit log for the repo of the Friendly Github Intro lesson. Each commit entry has an associated date and time, the author, and the summary of the commit message." alt="A screenshot of the website https://github.com/uf-repro/friendly-github-intro/commits/main, showing the commit log for the repo of the Friendly Github Intro lesson. Each commit entry has an associated date and time, the author, and the summary of the commit message." width="1505"> * Constructing a Commit * each commit is created <em>manually</em> - <code>add</code> files with changes (including new files) - run <code>commit</code> command<br>
write the commit message * Why so tedious? - You have full control over the changes that are recorded in each commit * Navigating Commits * Git generates a unique <strong>hash</strong> for each commit * You can retrieve a commit by using the <code>checkout</code> command and the desired hash * The file/folder contents will change to reflect the project state for that commit. <em>In Git, files and folders are temporary; nothing is saved and safe unless it is in a <strong>commit</strong>.</em></p>

<p>file backup = store a copy somewhere else <strong>How do you backup a Git repository?</strong> Git stores all of the information about commits, history, etc. the <code>.git</code> folder of your project * <code>.git</code> is normally hidden * You can copy over the project folder, and it will contain the full git history. (e.g. You can store it in Dropbox.) * You can also specify other locations to synchronize a git repository to.<br>
These are called <strong>remotes</strong>. * GitHub GitHub acts as a <strong>remote</strong> in the cloud. 1. Create an empty GitHub repo to be your remote location 2. Synchronize this GitHub repo to your computer 3. <code>push</code> will send all new commits on the current branch to GitHub 4. <code>pull</code> will retrieve new commits from GitHub * Branches Let You Experiment * About Branches For simple projects, your commits may proceed in a linear fashion: - each commit is a step forward But you might want to work on different aspects of your project at the same time! <strong>branches</strong> allow you to label and save work that may or may not end up in a final version to be published. <img src="git-branch.svg" title="A diagram from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches, of a git repo represented in a diagram with commits as circular nodes, with edges between them showing the relationship between commits and their parents. There is a `Master` branch in light blue, a `Little Feature` branch in purple with one commit, and a `Big Feature` branch in green with 3 commits." alt="A diagram from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches, of a git repo represented in a diagram with commits as circular nodes, with edges between them showing the relationship between commits and their parents. There is a `Master` branch in light blue, a `Little Feature` branch in purple with one commit, and a `Big Feature` branch in green with 3 commits." width="80%"> [img: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches" class="external-link uri">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches</a>] * different branches are separate paths, and in different colors * each point on a branch is a commit * Creating new branches (GitHub) <img src="github-new-branch.png" title="screenshot of the GitHub interface, when clicking on the pulldown menu to switch branches; this interface also enables one to create new branches." alt="screenshot of the GitHub interface, when clicking on the pulldown menu to switch branches; this interface also enables one to create new branches." width="1773"> * Tips for Creating Branches * choose names that won’t overlap with anyone else’s:<br>
“&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;feature&amp;gt;” is a common strategy<br>
e.g. “hao-update-readme” * double check which branch you are in before making a commit! * A Merge/Pull Request Combines Work from Separate Branches * Merges A <strong>merge</strong> combines changes from separate branches together into a new commit. * If the changes are in separate files or separate sections of a common file, merging is automatic. * Otherwise, a <strong>merge conflict</strong> occurs, and you need to manually reconcile the differences for the merge commit. * Example Merge Conflict <img src="merge-conflict.png" title="A screenshot of BBedit showing the merge conflict. Line 6 is '&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD'`' indicating the start of one version of the file. Line 8 is '=======' indicating the end of one version and the beginning of the next. Line 10 shows '&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;' followed by a hash, indicating the end of the second version." alt="A screenshot of BBedit showing the merge conflict. Line 6 is '&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD'`' indicating the start of one version of the file.

Line 10 shows '&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;' followed by a hash, indicating the end of the second version." width="1437"> * Pull Requests On Github, merges start by creating a <strong>pull request</strong>. Pull requests are a way for a maintainer or a team to review and comment on merges <em>before they happen</em>. <img src="new-pull-request.png" title="The GitHub interface for creating a new Pull Request. The important elements are selecting the 'Pull Requests' tab and the green button for 'New pull request'." alt="The GitHub interface for creating a new Pull Request. The important elements are selecting the 'Pull Requests' tab and the green button for 'New pull request'." width="2253"> * Creating a Pull Request <img src="pull-request.png" title="The GitHub interface for creating a Pull Request. The important elements are the selection of the 'base' branch that will take the merge, the 'compare:' branch that has the new commits to be merged, the title of the pull request (with the text 'Update index.md'), the text box (which is empty), and the green button for 'Create pull request'." alt="The GitHub interface for creating a Pull Request. The important elements are the selection of the 'base' branch that will take the merge, the 'compare:' branch that has the new commits to be merged, the title of the pull request (with the text 'Update index.md'), the text box (which is empty), and the green button for 'Create pull request'." width="2272"> * Collaborating on GitHub * Sharing Repos On GitHub, you can add other accounts as collaborators to give them write access. If you try to work in the same branch, you have to wait for the other person to finish making changes before you can make changes! We don’t have time for this! * GitHub Flow for Collaborations * a primary branch, e.g. “main”, stores the working version of the project * updates happen in branches * when work is ready to be merged into “main”, create a <strong>pull request</strong> * after merging, unneeded branches can be deleted * Benefits * multiple lines of work can happen at the same time, in <strong>different branches</strong> * subteams can work together on shared branches - pull request from separate branches to a shared group branch - discussions can happen in the pull request * Exercise We will now test out the <strong>GitHub Flow</strong> system on your project repos: 1. create a new branch<br>
(named “&amp;lt;your name&amp;gt;-readme”) 2. in GitHub, add your name to the Team section of the README file, and commit the changes 3. create a pull request to the <strong>main</strong> branch * Takeaway Messages * <strong>commits</strong> are records of your project * <strong>branches</strong> are alternate timelines * <strong>merges</strong> &amp; <strong>pull requests</strong> combine work across branches * the <strong>GitHub Flow</strong> system lets you collaborate as a team ## Thanks</p>
