# Preliminaties

This lesson assumes you:

--

**NO** previous experience with Git or GitHub is required!

---
# Learning Objectives

1 hour is insufficient to teach you how to use Git and GitHub in a data analysis workflow.

# Basic Concepts

---

# Version Control

**Version Control**: tools/systems to manage changes to files

--
## You are probably already using version control!

* MS Word has "track changes"
* Dropbox / Google Drive can revert versions

---

# Why Learn Git & GitHub

Git & GitHub are version control for **projects**.

You can:
* restore project states involving changes to multiple files.
* track *who* made *what* changes and *why*
* handle changes in any file format
* manage work from large distributed teams

---

# Example scenarios

* You change a histogram to a bar plot, and then you want to change it back.
* Your collaborator makes edits while traveling, and you need to combine their changes with changes you made in the meantime.
* You want to experiment with a different dataset / analysis / narrative without duplicating everything.

---

# Git and GitHub

--

## (not the same thing!)

---

# Git

* **Git** is the name of the software and the associated version control system
* notoriously unfriendly
  - unintuitive command names
  - obscure error messages

---

# GitHub

* a cloud platform that hosts Git repos
* unlimited *public* and *private* repos
* size limits:
  - 1 GB for each repo
  - 100 MB for individual files
* [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/pack) has some benefits
  - one code for a free t-shirt from https://github.myshopify.com/ to be given away to a random attendee

# Git tracks versions for **projects**

---
# Basic Mechanics

* Versioning occurs on the level of a projects:
  - A project folder is a **repository** or **repo**, for short.
* Changes are recorded by taking a snapshot of the folder:
  - each snapshot is called a **commit**.

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A screenshot of the website https://github.com/uf-repro/friendly-github-intro/commits/main, showing the commit log for the repo of the Friendly Github Intro lesson. Each commit entry has an associated date and time, the author, and the summary of the commit message."}
knitr::include_graphics("commits_example.png")
```

---
# Commit Structure

* each commit has a **commit message**
  - 1-line summary
  - blank line
  - further details
* each commit also records **who** and **when**
* good commit messages help you find the right past project state!

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A screenshot of the website https://github.com/uf-repro/friendly-github-intro/commits/main, showing the commit log for the repo of the Friendly Github Intro lesson. Each commit entry has an associated date and time, the author, and the summary of the commit message."}
knitr::include_graphics("commits_example.png")
```

---

# Constructing a Commit

* each commit is created *manually*
  - `add` files with changes (including new files)
  - `commit` and write the commit message

--
* Why so tedious?
  - this procedure gives you control over which changes are recorded in each commit

---

# Navigating Commits

* Git generates a unique **hash** for each commit
* You can view the project state by using the `checkout` command and the desired hash
* The file/folder contents will change to reflect the project state for that commit.

--

*In Git, files and folders are mutable; nothing is safe unless it is in a **commit**.*

# Branches Let You Experiment

---

For simple projects, your commits might proceed in a linear fashion:
  - each commit is an incremental step forward
    (commits track only changes from the previous commit)

But you might be working on different aspects of your project at the same time!

--

**branches** allow you to label and save work that may or may not end up in a final version to be published.

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.alt = "A diagram from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches, of a git repo represented in a diagram with commits as circular nodes, with edges between them showing the relationship between commits and their parents. There is a `Master` branch in light blue, a `Little Feature` branch in purple with one commit, and a `Big Feature` branch in green with 3 commits."}
knitr::include_graphics("git-branch.svg")
```

.small[[img: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches]]

* different branches are separate paths, and in different colors
* each point on a branch is a commit

---

# Merges

A `merge` combines changes from separate branches together into a new commit.

--

* If the changes are in separate files or separate sections of a common file, merging is automatic.

* Otherwise, a **merge conflict** occurs, and you need to manually reconcile the differences for the merge commit.

---
# Example Merge Conflict

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A screenshot of BBedit showing the merge conflict. Line 6 is '<<<<<<< HEAD'`' indicating the start of one version of the file. Line 8 is '=======' indicating the end of one version and the beginning of the next. Line 10 shows '>>>>>>>' followed by a hash, indicating the end of the second version."}

# GitHub as a Backup System

---

Making a file backup = storing a copy in another location

**How do you backup a Git repository?**

--

Git stores all of the information about the commit history, etc. inside a hidden folder called `.git` within the project folder.

* You can copy over the project folder, and it will contain the full git history. (e.g. You can store it in Dropbox.)

* You can also specify other locations to synchronize a git repository to.  
  These are called **remotes**.

---
# GitHub

GitHub acts as a cloud platform to store remotes.

Workflow:
1. Create an empty GitHub repository to be the remote location for a project
2. Add the address for the new, empty repo on GitHub as a remote, usually called "origin".
3. `push` will send all new commits on the current branch to the default remote ("origin")
4. `pull` will retrieve new commits from the remote.

---
# Restoring from GitHub

1. From a GitHub repository, obtain the address.
2. `clone` will create a local copy of the repository, and automatically include its source as the remote named "origin".

--

In a public GitHub repo, anyone can obtain the files along with the whole history of the project in its commits.

# GitHub as a Collaboration Platform

---
# Visibility

**Public** repos are visible to everyone.

**Private** repos are visible only to collaborators.

--

You can toggle a repo between **public** and **private** as needed.

---
# Sharing Repos

On GitHub, you can add other accounts as collaborators to give them write access.

--

## Example scenario

Two people, A and B, are working together:
* A `commits`, A `pushes` to GitHub.
* B `pulls` the changes, creates new `commits`, and `pushes` to GitHub.
* A must `pull` the changes from GitHub.

---

# The GitHub Flow System

**Github Flow** is a system for easier collaborations using a shared GitHub repo:

* a primary branch, e.g. "main", stores the current, working versions of the project
* work is carried out in branches
* when work is ready to be merged into "main", a **pull request** is created on GitHub
  - this allows discussion and review
* after merging, unneeded branches can be deleted

---
# Takeaway Messages

* **commits** are project states
* **branches** are alternate timelines
* **GitHub** is a cloud platform for backups and collaboration
